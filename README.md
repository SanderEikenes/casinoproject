# Casino Project

Welcome to the **Casino Project**! This is a web-based casino platform developed using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. The primary focus of this project was to enhance my skills in integrating databases with a web application.

## Features

- **Live Chat**: Engage with other users on the platform in real-time through the live chat feature.
- **Currency System**: Manage your in-game currency for betting.
- **Casino Game - Mines**: A classic Minesweeper-inspired game where users can try their luck.

## Technologies Used

## Why This Project?

This project was built as a learning exercise to improve my skills in database integration within web applications. By working with **Supabase** and **Clerk**, I got a better understanding of backend integration, user management, and cool real-time features.
